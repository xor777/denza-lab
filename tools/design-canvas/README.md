# Design canvas

The artboards behind the Denza Apps redesign, and the tooling that keeps
them honest. Published as a Claude Design canvas; these are the sources it is
seeded from.

## Why this is in the repo

An adversarial review of the first cut of these boards found about sixty defects
and almost none of them were judgement calls. A tick lying along an arc instead
of across it, a label naming 60 kW at an angle that meant 150, twenty-seven type
sizes where six were declared, four sibling boards on four different grids, a
readout with a rule through its own numeral: every one of those is a measurement,
and measurements should not be made by hand twice.

So the boards are not drawn any more. The instrument boards are *computed* from
the same constants the app draws with, and every board is *measured* by a script
that reports what collides.

## The files

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `*.dc.html` | the artboards, one sandboxed document each |
| `canvas.json` | positions, pages and the launch view |
| `gen_cluster.py` | emits the three cluster boards as they stand on the car today, with the current fixed 3 km consumption window |
| `gen_next.py` | emits the proposed cluster: one horizon, two histories, the gauge |
| `gen_kit.py` | emits the two boards that describe the system, from the system |
| `panel_frame.py` | archived tooling for the four retired head-unit instrument concepts; rebuilds Energy |
| `normalize.py` | maps type, radii, borders and icon weights onto the scales |
| `audit.py` | opens every board in headless Chrome and reports what collides |
| `shot.py` | renders one board to a PNG at panel pixels, so it can be looked at |
| `compare.py` | lays a board against a screenshot of the car and reports what moved |

`Energy.dc.html`, `Battery.dc.html`, `Thermal.dc.html`, `Engine.dc.html` and the
old pager compositions in `OneThird.dc.html` and `TwoThirds.dc.html` are kept as
historical design evidence. Those head-unit pages are retired and are not a
current app contract. The active contracts are the head-unit `Main.dc.html`
spectrum strip and the cluster boards; the cluster consumption history has one
fixed 3 km window and no selector.

## Running the audit

```bash
python3 audit.py
```

It inlines each board into its own iframe, lets the page measure itself, and
reports four things: text past its artboard, text past the column it was placed
in, text meeting text it has no relationship with, a flat rule crossing a
numeral - plus the type sizes, radii and stroke weights each board actually uses.
Nothing may sit outside the ramps below.

It knows about occlusion: text under a modal scrim is covered, not colliding, and
adjacent cells of a segmented control are meant to touch.

What it does not check is a label overflowing the control it sits in. On
`AdbGateNarrow.dc.html` the primary action's words run out past both ends of their
own pill, and the audit reports that board clean: the text is inside the artboard,
inside its column, and touching nothing it is unrelated to. Until that check
exists, a narrow board has to be looked at as well as measured.

## Looking at a board

```bash
python3 shot.py Main --scale 2
```

PNGs land in `_shots/`, untracked. Scale 1 is the 1280x800 the head-unit boards
are drawn in; scale 2 is the 2560x1600 the screen actually has, which is what to
compare a screenshot of the car against.

A board is not just its `<x-dc>` body: the `<script data-dc-script>` block after
`</x-dc>` holds the data every `<sc-for>` loops over - the spectrum's bars, a
picker's applications. A renderer that takes the body alone shows an empty field
and gives no sign it dropped anything. That happened here, and the empty picture
was believed over the board: the owner was told the spectrum analyser had never
been designed while it sat in `Main.dc.html`, drawn, with its own data.

So every line `shot.py` prints ends with `loops: N left: M` - the loops the board
declares against the ones still standing in the rendered DOM. `left: 0` is the
only good answer. Anything else is marked HOLES, and the picture is not evidence.

## The canvas the app actually gets

Measured off the car, not assumed:

| | px | dp @2.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| screen | 2560 x 1600 | 1280 x 800 |
| app window | 2560 x 1472 | 1280 x 736 |
| status band over it | 112 tall | 56 |
| system dock below it | 128 tall | 64 |
| **what the app can draw** | **2560 x 1360** | **1280 x 680** |

The head-unit boards are 1280 x 800. The app never has 800 dp and never will: the
dock takes 64 off the bottom before the window even exists, and an opaque status
band takes 56 more off the top. So every one of those boards is drawn on 120 dp of
height that does not exist - fifteen per cent - and anything laid out to fill the
board arrives on the car compressed, scrolled, or off the bottom edge.

Horizontally there is nothing to correct: the background runs edge to edge and the
first tile starts at 96 px, which is the `48` side margin exactly.

This is the first thing to fix before "pixel perfect" means anything, and it is not
a fix any single board can carry - it changes what fits on all of them.

## Comparing a board with the car

```bash
python3 compare.py Main --car screenshot.png
python3 compare.py Main --capture          # takes one off the vehicle
```

It renders the board at the car's scale, lays the two side by side with a heat map
between them, and reports the cells whose mean colour moved, in board coordinates.
It compares over a grid rather than pixel by pixel on purpose: Skia and Chrome
rasterise the same glyph differently, and a per-pixel diff reports nothing but
that. A cell that moves is a layout or a colour that moved.

`--capture` is the only thing in this directory that touches the vehicle.

Read the number with the build in mind. A 62 % difference on a car running last
week's APK is last week's APK, not a design that has drifted - the comparison is
only as honest as the pair of things being compared, and it will not tell you which
one is stale.

## One screen, two widths

The head unit gives an app three window widths - 1280 dp full screen, 828 dp for
two thirds, 416 dp for one third - and the third of those is where a design fails
first. `AdbGate.dc.html` and `AdbGateNarrow.dc.html` are one screen drawn twice for
exactly that reason: same card, same components, same copy rules, 1280 against 416.

The wide one is comfortable. The narrow one shows a Row measuring its children in
order - the outlined action takes the width it asks for, the primary action is
handed what is left, and its label runs out past both ends of the button. That is
what ships today, drawn rather than described, and it is not fixed by anything on
the board: a two-button row does not fit 312 dp of card, and which button loses is
a product decision nobody has made yet.

A fullscreen-only board cannot show any of that, which is why the pair exists.
Any screen that can appear in a pane deserves the same treatment.

## The two ramps

The cluster and the head unit are different screens at different distances, so
they get different ladders. What they share is the rule: a size not on the ramp
is not available, and no two rungs sit closer than about 1.2x - a difference you
can measure and cannot see is a difference that will be drifted into.

| | rungs | step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cluster (virtual units, 1.70 on the panel) | 52 · 34 · 24 · 18 · 13 · 11 (+ `104`, proposal only) | 8 wide, 6 narrow |
| Head unit (pixels, 1:1) | 82 · 62 · 46 · 34 · 24 · 19 · 15 | 6 |

Spacing on the head unit is `48 · 32 · 20 · 12 · 8 · 4`, six rungs none closer
than one and a half times the one below: the screen margin, the gap between two
groups, the padding inside a surface, the gap between neighbours in a group, the
gap between two lines of one thought, and the gap between a glyph and its word.
That ladder is newer than the others and it is the one that had no counterpart
in the app at all - the head unit's screen was spending seventeen adjacent
values between 4 and 32.

Radii are `22 · 12 · 6 · 2` plus a track's own half-height. Borders are one pixel
- selection is carried by fill and ink, never by a thicker edge. Icons carry one
optical weight of `2.0`, so a stroke is `2.0 × 24 ÷ rendered size`.

Sizes that belong to one component rather than to a ladder are named rather than
placed: the tile is `164`, its icon `30`, an application tile `96` with a `44`
icon, a settings panel `480` on the right edge with a `62` action under it, a
picker's grid stops growing at `360`, a row a finger has to hit is `56` and a
segmented control `42`. They live beside the ladders in `DenzaMetrics` so
that a fixed height is a decision with a name on it rather than a number typed
where it was needed.

The head unit's ladders live in `dev.denza.apps.design.DenzaMetrics`, and
`DenzaMetricsTest` measures the gaps rather than the values - a rung a few per
cent from its neighbour cannot be chosen deliberately, so the gap is the thing
worth testing. `Main.dc.html` is drawn on those same numbers.

The cluster ramp is `InstrumentDensity.RAMP` in the app and the boards restate
it; `gen_cluster.py` is the one place to check that they still agree. That ramp
is the six rungs from `52` down to `11`, and the app draws nothing else.

`104` is not on it. It is the headline numeral of the proposed cluster and it
lives on the `gen_next.py` boards alone, because the app does not draw that
cluster yet and a constant nothing reads is not a ramp rung, it is a promise.
It is sized as one deliberately - exactly twice `52`, so that adopting the
proposal extends the ladder rather than starting a second one beside it - and
it joins `InstrumentDensity.RAMP` on the day the proposal is adopted, in the
same change, or not at all.

The first draft of those boards ran at `58` and `19` beside the ramp's own `52`
and `18`, which is the drift the ramp exists to prevent: a difference you can
measure and cannot see. This page then claimed the two records agreed while
`104` sat in one and not the other, which is the same failure one level up -
caught by the parallel session reading both, not by anything here.

## Application icons come off the car

The boards used to draw an application as its initial in a well - "Я", "Н", "2".
It looked tidy in a way the screen never will: real icons are square, saturated
and drawn by six different vendors with six different ideas about padding, and a
row of them is the thing that actually has to hold together. A board that draws
letters is not showing the problem.

So the icons on `Config.dc.html` are the car's own, cropped out of a screenshot of
the panel and embedded as base64. Not pulled from the APKs and re-rendered - taken
as the head unit draws them, adaptive-icon shaping and all. The code was never at
fault here: `DenzaAppTile` has always taken a `Drawable` from the PackageManager
and only falls back to the initial when there is genuinely no icon.

Comparing the two also settled an order. The board put our own instruments first;
the app puts them last, on the reasoning that they are the one choice that can
never be missing, so leading with them pushes whichever navigator the driver
actually uses one tile along. That is an argument about the driver's hand rather
than about implementation, so the board gave way.

## The boards and the code are joined

A board and the screen it designs are two records of one decision, and for a
while nothing compared them. `audit.py` measures the boards against themselves,
`DenzaMetricsTest` measures the ladders against themselves, and the only thing
joining the two was somebody remembering. It did not hold: the first cut of the
head-unit screen carried every number off `Main.dc.html` and looked nothing like
it, because the board hangs a tile's words off the bottom edge and the code
stacked them from the top.

So two unit tests in `:denza-apps` parse the boards at test time and assert the
Kotlin matches:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `MainBoardContractTest` | reads `Main.dc.html` - tile height, padding, radius, the `space-between` that hangs the words apart, both text styles with their leading, icon size and stroke, grid columns and gap, page margins |
| `SpectrumBoardContractTest` | reads the analyser out of the same board - band count, bar width fraction, peak height, corner radius, gradient stop, reflection crop and opacity, scanline pitch |

They fail in both directions on purpose. Editing a board without the code breaks
them, and so does editing the code without the board - which means neither record
can move alone, and a design change that never reached the app cannot pass CI
looking finished. What they cannot do is run Compose: they prove the constants
and the declarations agree, not that the drawn result does. That still takes
`shot.py` beside a screenshot of the car, which is the step that was skipped.

## Regenerating and republishing

```bash
python3 gen_cluster.py && python3 gen_next.py && python3 gen_kit.py && python3 audit.py
```

Then seed a fresh payload with the `design` skill's `seed-canvas.mjs` and publish
to the existing canvas, pinned to the runtime it was built for:

    https://claude.ai/code/artifact/f97891c4-0dd3-4467-a879-6a1d59ea8f73
    contract 0.1.31

That page is the owner's private artifact - the link is here so the canvas can be
updated rather than forked, not because it opens for everyone. Publishing to a new
URL leaves two canvases drifting apart, which is the failure this whole directory
exists to prevent. `normalize.py` and `panel_frame.py` are one-shot
migrations kept for the record; running them again is harmless but unnecessary.
